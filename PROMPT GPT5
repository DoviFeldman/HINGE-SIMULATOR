First Prompt:

Make for me a GitHub pages website that is a hinges simulator where I can place hinges and joints and lines and see how they move and their path

Second Prompt:




Great. Can you give me the lines of code to add an option to keep specific rods to keep their length if I press a button? And also a measurement option? And an option to be able to drag everything myself with the rods length locked without having to use the motor(which might allready be there if we lock the rods length, but I would also like to add tracers to that.) 
Please give it to me with all the code and instructions on where to put it, I will tell me AI assistant who's in charge of my code to place it there so write that part talking to them. Thank you.
